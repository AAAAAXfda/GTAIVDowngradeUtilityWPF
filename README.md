## Contribution
Contribution is highly welcome. I'm poorly experienced with C#, but this rewrite was needed for many reasons. And so, the current code is extremely clunky and works out of prayers.

## Attribution
Following NuGet packages were used to create this app:

- [Microsoft-WindowsAPICodePack-Shell](https://github.com/contre/Windows-API-Code-Pack-1.1) by rpastric, contre, dahall - allows to create a Choose File dialogue box.
- And Microsoft's official packages such as [System.Management](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Management/) for convenience and functional code.
